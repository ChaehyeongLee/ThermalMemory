# Analysis Functions for Thermal Memory Research

You can find every core function for analysis done on the Nature Climate Change paper (Lee et al. 2025)

Analysis directory:
 includes core functions. You can reproduce and verify the research with proper Sea Surface Temperature and Atmospheric variables (2m temperature, surface heat flux, and 10m wind)

Database directory:
 You can download all dataset shown in the research paper on Zenodo repository.
